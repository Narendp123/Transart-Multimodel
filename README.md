# Transart-Multimodel

TransArt: A Multimodal Application for Vernacular Language Processing and AI-Generated Content

Problem Statement

To develop an AI-powered web application that processes Tamil audio input, transcribes it into Tamil text, translates it into English, and then generates relevant images and creative written content based on the translated text. This project showcases a seamless pipeline integrating speech recognition, language translation, text-to-image synthesis, and AI-driven text generation.
Key Features

    🎙 Tamil Audio Processing: Converts Tamil speech into text using Whisper Large v3.
    🌍 Tamil-to-English Translation: Accurately translates transcribed Tamil text into English using LLaMA 3 (Groq-supported model).
    🖼 AI Image Generation: Generates high-quality images using Stable Diffusion 2.1 (stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1).
    ✍ Creative Text Generation: Produces engaging written content from the translated text using LLaMA 3 (8B-8192).
    🖥 User-Friendly Web Interface: Implemented using Gradio for easy interaction.
